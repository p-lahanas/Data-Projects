##  Detection of Cholesterol Presence in Food
As part of a university course, I was required to apply several machine learning techniques to a dataset containing food nutrient composition. I decided to solve a classification problem where food is classified as either containing or not containing cholesterol based on its nutritional composition. The models and techniques investigated include:
1. Decision Tree
2. K-NN
3. Logistic Regression
4. Bagging and Boosting
5. Neural Network (MLP)
6. Model Evaluation (hold-out validation)
